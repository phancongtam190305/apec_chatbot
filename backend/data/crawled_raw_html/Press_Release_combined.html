					Korea’s Minister for Trade Inkyo Cheong of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) held high-level bilateral talks with trade representatives of 14 APEC member economies and the World Trade Organization (WTO) through May 14-16 on Jeju Island, as part of a series of bilateral meetings convened on the sidelines of the 2025 APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) Meeting. During the talks, he took stock of the recent developments in U.S. tariff consultations with major economies and discussed measures to enhance trade and economic cooperation in addressing global trade uncertainties. First, Trade Minister Cheong met with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on May 15 to discuss the status of U.S. tariff consultations with major economies and to exchange views on the Korea-U.S. technical discussions launched on May 1. Representative Greer noted Korea’s efforts to deliver meaningful outcomes through this year’s APEC MRT Meeting as chair of APEC 2025. On May 16, Trade Minister Cheong held a meeting with Masaki Okushi, Vice Minister of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Miyaji Takuma, Vice Minister of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). Commemorating the 60th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations, the two sides agreed to deepen collaboration in key areas like advanced industries, hydrogen and other emerging energy sectors, and supply chain resilience. They also pledged to work together toward the success of APEC 2025 and the Osaka-Kansai Expo and to actively leverage both Korea-Japan and Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation platforms. In the meeting with Budi Santoso, Indonesia’s Minister of Trade, Trade Minister Cheong emphasized that more than 2,000 Korean companies are currently operating in Indonesia, requesting the Indonesian government’s support in resolving challenges faced by Korean firms including local certification and import restriction issues so as to ensure stable business operations.

Taking inspiration from Korea's APEC 2025 theme "Building a Sustainable Tomorrow", we have advanced APEC’s agenda through three thematic priorities: Connectivity through Multilateral Trading System, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Innovation for Trade Facilitation, and Prosperity through Sustainable Trade.   3. We remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, including through the implementation of the Aotearoa Plan of Action to build an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific community for the prosperity of all our people and future generations. We are concerned with the fundamental challenges faced by the global trading system. We remain committed to APEC as the premier forum for regional economic cooperation and emphasize the importance of its role in bringing us together to address the economic challenges facing our region and create a more resilient and prosperous Asia-Pacific region.   4. We recognize the importance of the WTO to advance trade issues, and acknowledge the agreed upon rules in the WTO as an integral part of the global trading system. We recognize the WTO has challenges and needs meaningful, necessary, and comprehensive reform to improve all its functions, through innovative approaches, to be more relevant and responsive in light of today’s realities. We commend the efforts to deepen discussions in the WTO on contemporary trade issues. We intend to work collaboratively through APEC's role as an incubator of ideas and support Members working together to deliver a successful Fourteenth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC14) in March 2026 in Cameroon.   5. We welcome the acceptance by 16 APEC economies of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, and call on remaining economies to complete their domestic procedures, and encourage all WTO Members to conclude negotiations on additional disciplines as soon as possible. We recognize the need for a constructive engagement on agriculture at the WTO. We also note the extension of the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions as decided at MC13. We note the importance of enhancing predictability for the development of the digital economy. We welcome efforts to continue to reinvigorate work under the Work Program on Electronic Commerce.   6. We recognize the positive role of plurilateral negotiations at the WTO, including the Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs), for advancing issues of interest to Members and to make the WTO more relevant. We welcome the progress made and emphasize their roles to address contemporary trade issues, foster new ideas, facilitate economic growth, and build momentum toward multilateral outcomes.

We recognize the important role of the digitalization of the economy as a driver for innovation, productivity and economic growth across the region. As we approach the completion of the Work Program for the Implementation of the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap (AIDER) in 2025, we recognize the need to systematically develop an approach for the continued advancement of AIDER’s objective beyond 2025, in a way that addresses emerging challenges and opportunities in the rapidly evolving digital landscape and its impact on trade and investment.

In this regard, we acknowledge benefits of public-private collaboration and look forward to further exploratory discussions on such collaboration for paperless trade. We encourage working towards aligning our legal frameworks with the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) noting the different levels of readiness and capacity.    11. We recognize AI’s potential to fundamentally reshape the landscape of international trade. We acknowledge the importance of adopting AI-enabled procedures that contribute to trade facilitation, particularly with enhancing customs procedures. We encourage economies to share information on domestic approaches to relevant AI-related policy with the private sector, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), to help businesses identify opportunities and risks as well as improve competitiveness. To support ongoing efforts in AI-driven transformation and capacity building across the APEC region, we intend to discuss opportunities for voluntary information exchange on trade-related AI standards and technologies that takes into account and complements the work of appropriate specialized international organizations, processes, and other efforts.   12.

We also reaffirm the importance of quality infrastructure development and investment. We remain committed to the full and effective implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, recognizing its relevance in an evolving trade environment.   13.

This framework may take into account the expanding role of digitally enabled services, as well as the impact of emerging technologies. In this regard, we further encourage cross-fora cooperation to discuss how to foster innovative services.   16.

We recognize the importance of women’s economic empowerment, including through access to capital, assets, markets, and leadership positions, including in line with relevant APEC initiatives including APEC principles and recommendations. We acknowledge the valuable contributions of Indigenous Peoples as appropriate to economic growth and welcome further dialogues and collaborative efforts focused on capacity building to increase their participation in regional and global markets.   20. We express our appreciation to the Republic of Korea for hosting this meeting and look forward to our continued collaboration throughout 2025.</a>

					Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) is holding the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) meeting from May 15–16 at the International Convention Center Jeju (ICC Jeju). As Korea is resuming APEC chairmanship in 20 years since 2005, Minister for Trade Inkyo Cheong is chairing the MRT meeting with the participation of trade ministers from 21 major economies in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, and the U.S., as well as the WTO Director-General and the OECD Deputy Secretary-General. Amid the rapidly shifting global trade environment, this year’s APEC MRT meeting is the trade ministers’ first official gathering for multilateral cooperation. Discussions will cover various trade issues and intraregional cooperation measures, such as the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. In line with the 2025 APEC theme of “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper,” the MRT meeting consists of three sessions on the following topics: AI innovation for trade facilitation, connection through multilateral trade, and prosperity through sustainable trade.  In the first session, participants address wide-ranging measures for cooperation to catalyze AI utilization in trade areas such as AI application and standard information sharing in the field of tariffs and customs, with OECD Deputy Secretary-General Yoshiki Takeuchi as the keynote speaker. The second session focuses on WTO reform and role of APEC in restoring the multilateral trade system, with WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala speaking on WTO reform and future cooperation for multilateral trade. The last session on prosperity through sustainable trade, to convene on May 16, will have participants exchange views on measures for joint efforts in establishing a sustainable supply chain, including climate crisis response. In his opening message, Trade Minister Cheong noted the current difficult external environment surrounding APEC and stated that the need for APEC is greater than ever considering the severe global trade situation. He further expressed hope that this MRT meeting will serve as a platform for communication and cooperation that contributes to resolving political and economic tensions and uncertainties that the world is facing today.</a>

It convenes four official meetings and one informal meeting each year, with the outcomes reported to the APEC Ministerial Meeting and APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.     - Korea is represented by Lee Jiyoon, Deputy Director-General for International Economic Affairs at the ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in her capacity as Korea’s Senior Official.      Notably, during SOM2, all 21 APEC member economies endorsed the establishment of the APEC “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations,” which aims to support young professionals’ participation in the economy and capacity building, recognizing the young generation as key drivers in advancing this year’s APEC theme, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow.” At the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Peru last November, Korea formally proposed the establishment of the “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations” and pledged an initial contribution of USD 1 million to launch this initiative. The Fund is expected to support a wide array of projects, including: knowledge exchange among young professionals in education, science, and policy; capacity-building in emerging digital technologies such as ICT and artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, big data, and advanced manufacturing technologies; and the promotion of youth entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, it will provide support for policy research that responds to the needs and challenges facing the young generation such as issues related to demographic changes and environmental challenges. The Fund’s establishment will be finalized upon completion of the remaining administrative procedures within APEC.      Furthermore, Korea presented the key elements of its key deliverables for APEC 2025, namely “APEC AI Initiative” and “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” during SOM2 and various sub-fora meetings. These elements are expected to serve as the basis for the outcome documents of the APEC Leaders’ Meeting later this year.      The proposed “APEC AI Initiative” aims to harness AI to accelerate economic transformation, foster resilient growth, drive technological advancement, and empower the workforce. This initiative envisions: providing strategic direction for successful AI transitions within APEC; building AI capacities across all sectors, including governments, businesses, workers, and consumers; and promoting a sustainable and robust ecosystem for AI-related infrastructure investment.      The proposed “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” seeks to address population trends such as declining birth rates and population aging, which are shared challenges across the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative aims to turn these demographic challenges into opportunities for future growth and innovation by: promoting sustainable systems to support aging societies; fostering medical and technological innovation; and enhancing economic participation for women.     In conjunction with SOM2, a series of ministerial meetings were also held, including the Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting (HRDMM) (May 11–13), the APEC Education Ministerial Meeting (May 13–15), and the Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) Meeting (May 15–16). At the HRDMM, a Joint Statement was adopted, outlining shared commitments to building sustainable labor markets and jobs for the future.     On the sidelines of SOM2, Korea held bilateral consultations with Senior Officials from China, Peru, Australia, the Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei, engaging in broad discussions on key deliverables for APEC 2025 and agendas for ministerial meetings.     The Third Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM3) is scheduled to take place in Incheon between July and August. Ahead of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting later this year, eight sectoral ministerial meetings such as Digital &amp; AI, Food Security, and Women and the Economy, along with two high-level dialogues, will be held as scheduled.</a>

					Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) is hosting the APEC Sustainable Supply Chain Forum today at the International Convention Center Jeju (ICC Jeju) to seek strategic measures at the APEC-level to strengthen global supply chain sustainability and resilience through sharing of public-private cooperation measures with the participation of the APEC Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI) and various experts representing APEC members’ governments, industries, and research institutions. The forum consists of presentation sessions and a panel discussion. The first session addresses the conceptual transition of the supply chain’s focus from efficiency to sustainability and resilience. The second session introduces best practices against major challenges that private sectors face in the process of building sustainable supply chains. The third session covers strategic approaches for sustainable supply chain cooperation among APEC members. In the following panel discussion, participants will be exchanging views and concrete measures for cooperation on establishing global supply chains within the APEC region. Through this forum, MOTIE aims to lay down a foundation on which domestic companies can preemptively respond to realignments in the global supply chain based on sustainability and resilience. Forum outcomes will also be incorporated in developing future policy directions.</a>

In the months ahead, Korea will also continue its efforts to secure a sufficient number of Presidential Suites (PRS) for the leaders as well as high-quality accommodations for other participants, including business leaders.   - To embody APEC’s core value of cooperation and solidarity, Korea is meticulously planning major events such as an official dinner, leaders’ retreats, and the spouses’ program. Korea also plans to actively promote the 2025 APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting to be held in Gyeongju as well as Korea’s national brand on the global stage.   - In addition, the sponsorship framework aligned with APEC’s spirit was presented, outlining how the public and private sector will work together to ensure the successful hosting of the AELM, based on the principle of voluntary participation.   - The government and the private sector will coordinate efforts to actively engage business leaders both at home and abroad, and to prepare a range of side events aligned with the business engagement programs taking place during APEC Economic Leaders’ Week, including the CEO Summit and the Leaders’ Dialogue with the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).   4. Acting President Han emphasized that “considering the time required for infrastructure development and other preparations, now is the time to swiftly implement concrete plans.” In addition, the Acting President urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the lead, with all relevant ministries, local governments, and the private sector working together as one team to ensure that every aspect of the preparations is carried out flawlessly, leaving no room for error in the lead-up to the AELM.   - The Acting President also stressed the importance of the events that engage business leaders in supporting Korean companies as they expand their global business networks and in attracting greater investment to Korea. In this regard, he called on Mr. Chey Tae-won, Chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), and Mr. Lee Kyu-ho, ABAC Member and Vice Chairman of Kolon, to provide strong leadership in organizing the events.    5. Building on the outcome of this meeting, the government will continue thorough preparations so that the AELM—set to take place in Korea for the first time in 20 years—can serve as a comprehensive economic and cultural platform that drives regional economic cooperation and showcases Korea’s rich culture.</a>

Specifically, during the APEC session of the conference, Deputy Minister Kim highlighted APEC’s growing significance in addressing new global challenges such as geoeconomic shifts and the emergence of new technologies, amid rising uncertainties in the global order. He emphasized APEC’s role as an open forum that fosters creative solutions through discussions among member economies, as well as enables business networking and delivers tangible outcomes via the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) mechanism. Furthermore, he underscored that Korea, as this year’s APEC host, is working to produce key deliverables at the upcoming Economic Leaders’ Meeting, with its principal focus on AI and demographic changes. He also reaffirmed Korea’s commitment to close cooperation with China, which will be next year’s APEC host.   ※ As this year’s APEC host, Korea has selected “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper” as the theme and priorities for APEC 2025, with AI cooperation and responses to demographic changes as deliverables.   4.

Deputy Minister Kim also emphasized the need for Korea and China to strengthen economic cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally, particularly amid rising global economic uncertainties. To this end, he suggested that both countries continue close communication through cooperation channels such as the Korea-China Joint Economic Committee.   6. On the same day, Deputy Minister Kim met with Director-General Bai Tian of the Department of International Economic Affairs at China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Both sides agreed on the importance of cooperation not only at the bilateral level but also within regional and multilateral fora such as APEC and the G20, and pledged to actively collaborate on areas of mutual interest. Additionally, given that Korea and China will consecutively host APEC in 2025 and 2026, respectively, both sides agreed to maintain close communication to ensure the successful hosting of the two APEC Economic Leaders’ Meetings.   7. Meanwhile, during his visit to Beijing, Deputy Minister Kim also held a separate meeting with the heads of Korean public institutions in charge of economic, trade, and investment affairs based in Beijing. He paid close attention to concerns related to the investment and business environment for Korean companies in China, and exchanged views on strengthening support for Korean firms entering the Chinese market amid U.S.-China competition as well as on long-term strategies for Korea-China economic cooperation.   ※ Participants: Head of Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) China Office, Head of the Beijing Office of the Korea International Trade Association (KITA), Head of the China Office of the Korea Mine Rehabilitation and Mineral Resources Corporation (KOMIR), Head of the Beijing Representative Office of the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-SURE), Head of the Beijing Office of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), and Head of the Beijing Office of the Korea SMEs and Startups Agency (KOSME)   8. Deputy Minister Kim’s visit to China was seen as an opportunity to reaffirm the mutual understanding that, in the face of increasing uncertainties in the global economic environment, it is important for Korea and China to maintain close communication at all levels and enhance mutual trust to advance economic cooperation at the bilateral, regional, and global levels. Going forward, the Korean government plans to continue identifying areas of cooperation and make every diplomatic effort to foster a more mature and future-oriented Korea-China relationship.</a>

					First Senior Officials’ Meeting of APEC 2025 Successfully Held in Gyeongju   1. From February 24 to March 9, the First Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM1) and related meetings of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2025 were successfully held in Gyeongju, Korea, led by APEC SOM Chair Yoon Seongmee. The Korean government, this year’s APEC host economy, proposed “Artificial Intelligence (AI) Cooperation” and “Response to Demographic Changes in the Asia-Pacific Region” as key deliverables.   ※ APEC is the largest economic cooperation forum in the Asia-Pacific region, comprising 21 member economies including Korea, China, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States.   ※ The Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) serves as APEC’s high-level consultative body for discussions among its member economies on cooperation agendas. It is held four times and once annually in the form of formal and informal meetings, respectively, with their outcomes reported at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting and Ministerial Meeting.   - Korea was represented by Lee Jiyoon, Deputy Director-General for International Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in her capacity as Senior Official.   2. At the first official APEC event of 2025, Korea outlined two key deliverables for APEC-wide cooperation this year -- “AI Cooperation” and “Response to Demographic Changes” including challenges such as declining birth rates and aging populations.   3. Regarding AI, Korea proposed guiding principles to harness the limitless potential of AI in an inclusive and sustainable manner. With respect to demographic changes, Korea presented collaborative initiatives through which to turn demographic challenges into opportunities. Member economies welcomed these priorities, recognizing them as timely and relevant since these challenges are faced across the Asia-Pacific region. In that light, they expressed their strong interest in and support for Korea’s initiatives.   4. This event in Gyeongju consisted of a total of 24 meetings, including SOM1 (March 8-9); meetings of the Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI), the SOM Steering Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation (SCE), the Budget and Management Committee (BMC), and the Economic Committee (EC); and various sub-fora meetings. An APEC Finance and Central Bank Deputies’ Meeting was also convened. These meetings brought together approximately 2,000 participants, including delegations from all 21 APEC member economies and the APEC Secretariat.   5. Throughout the meetings held over two weeks, APEC members discussed concrete initiatives and action plans to achieve this year’s theme and priorities -- “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper” -- followed by a comprehensive review at SOM1 on the last two days of the event.   6. On the sidelines of the multilateral meetings, SOM Chair Yoon Seongmee and Senior Official Lee Jiyoon held bilateral meetings with senior officials from Canada, China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States. During the bilateral meetings, these member economies expressed strong support for Korea’s theme, priorities and key deliverables, as well as high expectations for Korea’s leadership as the host of APEC 2025 amid the rapidly evolving global dynamics of late.   7. Additionally, Korea held a “Troika” meeting with Peru and China, the previous and next APEC host economies, respectively, during which the three sides agreed to work closely together for a successful implementation of this year’s agenda and a continuity in APEC’s long-term efforts.   8. SOM1 also served as an opportunity to introduce to APEC members Gyeongju, the host city for the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in the second half of 2025. Participants praised the conference facilities, the progress in the preparation efforts, the seamless organization, and the hospitality provided for delegations. Gyeongju’s rich historical and cultural heritage also received high appreciation.   9. Looking ahead, Korea will hold SOM2 in Jeju (May) and SOM3 in Incheon (July-August) as well as 11 sectoral ministerial meetings and 2 high-level dialogues covering ocean-related affairs, human resources, education and trade, between those two SOMs. APEC 2025 will wrap up with the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in the second half of the year.</a>
